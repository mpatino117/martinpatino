Hello, folks the name is Martin Patino and welcome to my site built using Jekyll ðŸ˜ƒ

I am a 25 years old, I been on this development journey of mine ever since I discovered that technology can be used to positively impact the community. My development journey was not just a learning skills process, but also a growing experience.

My goal in life is to give back to the community and grow. The more I learn and grow them more I have to give. This site is to provide help for those individuals on there own personal journey be it in technology and or just need motivation in life. College is not the end goal young folks it is only the beginning of amazing journey.

I am the first of my all family to graduate from both high school and university. I have always been a ambitious young guy, but not for money and success, but knowledge. Let your curiosity guide you and as you may discover what your true passion is.

I encourage you to get involved in your community and help those around you as it can only bring you happiness. I follow my own advice and volunteer in my community. I am active volunteer at the Arizona Cyber Warfare Range, code-day as mentor, JavaScript meet-up and hackathons in the Arizona.

I invite you to use this website as a resource to help you achieve your goals in development. If I can help or inspire you in any way that I can, then thereâ€™s nothing that would make me happier.
